## 📌 Project Overview

* **Verification Methodology:** SystemVerilog OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
* **Architecture:** Layered Testbench (Generator, Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard, Coverage)
* **Communication:** Mailboxes for data transaction and Events for synchronization
* **Coverage:** Functional coverage with cross-coverage of input combinations

## 🔧 Design Under Test (DUT) - Kogge-Stone Adder

### Overview

The **Kogge-Stone Adder** is a parallel prefix adder that performs addition with logarithmic depth, making it one of the fastest adder architectures available. It achieves O(log₂n) delay by computing all intermediate carries in parallel using a tree structure.

### Key Features

* **Parameterizable Width:** Configurable WIDTH parameter (default: 16 bits)
* **Logarithmic Delay:** Number of stages = log₂(WIDTH) = 4 stages for 16-bit
* **Parallel Prefix Architecture:** Uses Generate (G) and Propagate (P) signals
* **Carry-in Support:** Incorporates carry-in at bit position 0
* **Optimal Performance:** Trades area for speed - more hardware but faster than ripple-carry adders

### Algorithm Stages

#### Stage 0: Initialization
Computes initial Propagate and Generate signals for each bit:
```
P[0][i] = A[i] XOR B[i]     // Propagate
G[0][i] = A[i] AND B[i]      // Generate
G[0][0] = A[0] AND B[0] OR (cin AND (A[0] XOR B[0]))  // Include carry-in
```

#### Stages 1 to log₂(WIDTH): Prefix Tree
Each stage combines signals at increasing distances (1, 2, 4, 8...):
```
Distance = 2^(stage-1)
For bit i >= distance:
    P[stage][i] = P[stage-1][i] AND P[stage-1][i-distance]
    G[stage][i] = G[stage-1][i] OR (P[stage-1][i] AND G[stage-1][i-distance])
```

#### Final Stage: Sum Computation
```
sum[0] = P[0][0] XOR cin
sum[i] = P[0][i] XOR G[final_stage][i-1]  // for i > 0
cout = G[final_stage][WIDTH-1]
```

### Module Interface

```systemverilog
module kogge_stone_adder #(
    parameter WIDTH = 16
) (
    input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] A,      // First operand
    input  logic [WIDTH-1:0] B,      // Second operand
    input  logic             cin,    // Carry input
    output logic [WIDTH-1:0] sum,    // Sum output
    output logic             cout    // Carry output
);
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Characteristic | Value (16-bit) |
|---------------|----------------|
| Number of Stages | 4 (log₂16) |
| Critical Path Delay | O(log n) |
| Area Complexity | O(n log n) |
| Advantage | Fastest parallel adder |
| Trade-off | Higher area vs ripple-carry |

### Example Operation

For a 16-bit addition: A=0x1234 + B=0x5678 + cin=1
1. **Stage 0:** Initialize 16 P and G signals
2. **Stage 1:** Combine at distance 1 (adjacent bits)
3. **Stage 2:** Combine at distance 2 (skip 1 bit)
4. **Stage 3:** Combine at distance 4 (skip 3 bits)
5. **Stage 4:** Combine at distance 8 (skip 7 bits)
6. **Output:** sum=0x68AD, cout=0

### Why Verify This Design?

The Kogge-Stone adder's complexity comes from:
- Multiple parallel computation stages
- Correct propagate/generate signal combinations
- Proper carry-in integration
- Edge cases at different bit positions
- Verification ensures all corner cases work correctly across the logarithmic tree structure

## 🏗️ Testbench Architecture

The testbench is organized into a modular environment where components communicate via **mailboxes** and **interfaces**.

```

### Key Features

* **Randomized Stimulus with Distribution:** Uses constrained randomization with `dist` constraints to ensure comprehensive coverage of input value ranges (min, low, mid, high, max bins)
* **Golden Reference Model:** The `scoreboard.sv` contains a reference model that independently calculates the expected sum and carry-out to verify the DUT's output
* **Functional Coverage:** Tracks coverage of input ranges, output ranges, carry-in, carry-out, and cross-coverage of input combinations
* **Event Synchronization:** The driver triggers a `sample_enable` event in the interface to notify the monitor exactly when to sample the stable output, preventing race conditions
* **Kogge-Stone Algorithm:** Implements the parallel prefix adder architecture for O(log n) delay with optimal performance

## 🎯 Functional Coverage Strategy

The verification environment includes comprehensive functional coverage to ensure thorough testing of the adder:

### Coverage Groups

The `coverage.sv` file defines a covergroup `cg_kogge_stone_adder` with the following coverpoints:

#### Input Coverage
* **cp_A (Input A):** Divided into 5 bins
  - `min`: 16'h0000 (minimum value)
  - `low`: 16'h0001 to 16'h5555 (lower quartile)
  - `mid`: 16'h5556 to 16'hAAAA (middle range)
  - `high`: 16'hAAAB to 16'hFFFE (upper quartile)
  - `max`: 16'hFFFF (maximum value)

* **cp_B (Input B):** Same bin structure as Input A

* **cp_cin (Carry-in):** Tracks when carry-in is asserted (1'b1)

#### Output Coverage
* **cp_sum (Sum Output):** Same 5-bin structure to verify output distribution
* **cp_cout (Carry-out):** Tracks when carry-out is asserted (1'b1)

#### Cross Coverage
* **cross_A_B_cin:** Cross-coverage of Input A × Input B × Carry-in
  - This creates 5 × 5 × 1 = 25 coverage bins
  - Ensures all important input combinations are tested
  - Helps identify corner cases and boundary conditions

### Constrained Random Distribution

The `transaction.sv` file uses distribution constraints to align with coverage bins:

```systemverilog
A dist { 
    16'h0000                := 20,  // min bin
    [16'h0001 : 16'h5555]   :/ 20,  // low bin
    [16'h5556 : 16'hAAAA]   :/ 20,  // mid bin
    [16'hAAAB : 16'hFFFE]   :/ 20,  // high bin
    16'hFFFF                := 20   // max bin
};
```

This ensures even distribution across all coverage bins, leading to faster coverage closure.

### Coverage Reporting

During simulation, the coverage collector:
1. Receives transactions from the monitor via the `mon2cov` mailbox
2. Samples the covergroup for each transaction
3. Displays real-time coverage percentage: `[COVERAGE] Current Coverage: XX.XX%`
4. Allows post-simulation coverage analysis through standard coverage reporting tools

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Top Level:** The `tb_top` module instantiates the interface and the Kogge-Stone adder DUT. It creates the environment and passes the virtual interface handle

2. **Generation:** The generator creates randomized transaction packets with distribution constraints to hit all coverage bins efficiently

3. **Driving:** The driver applies inputs A, B, and cin to the interface, triggers the `sample_enable` event for proper synchronization

4. **Monitoring:** The monitor waits for the `sample_enable` event, samples the DUT's response, and sends transactions to both the scoreboard and coverage collector

5. **Checking:** The scoreboard calculates the expected sum and carry-out and compares with actual DUT results

6. **Coverage Collection:** The coverage module samples functional coverage and reports progress throughout the simulation

## 📊 Simulation Output

When you run the simulation, the console will display the transaction flow, coverage progress, and final results.
